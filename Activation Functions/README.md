# Activation Functions

An implementation of activation functions in MATLAB. <br/>
Codes have been written with and without inbuilt functions for ease of understanding.
The following activation functions have been implemented:
- [Threshold using inbuilt](https://github.com/Yukti-09/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Activation%20Functions/Threshold(using%20inbuilt).m)
- [Threshold without using inbuilt](https://github.com/Yukti-09/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Activation%20Functions/Threshold(without%20inbuilt).m)
- [Softmax](https://github.com/Yukti-09/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Activation%20Functions/Softmax.m)
- [Signum using inbuilt](https://github.com/Yukti-09/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/Activation%20Functions/Signum(using%20inbuilt).m)
